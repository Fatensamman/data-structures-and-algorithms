# Tree

## Challenge
Create three classes: Node, BinaryTree, and BinarySearchTree, each with its own set of methods for the root, left, and right Node, and each method doing something different to execute this tree.

## Approach & Efficiency

* BinaryTree :
Space : O(h)
Time : O(n)

* BinarySearchTree :
Space : O(h)
Time : O(n)

## API

- BinaryTree :

Add Three Methods preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

- BinarySearchTree :

Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree

Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.
