## Challenge
create a stack class and queue class.

## Approach & Efficiency
- create a node class with two propertes : data, and next ;- 
### create a stack class , 
- create 4 methods belongs tho stack class which are
* push -> big O Time O(1), 
* pop ,
* peek,
* isEmpty

### create a queue class , 
- create 4 methods belongs tho queue class which are
* enqueue -> big O Time O(1), 
* dequeue ,
* peek,
* isEmpty

## API

- push: method which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack class.
- pop , dequeue: methods that removes the node from the top of the class, and returns the nodeâ€™s value.
- enqueue: method which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the stack class.
- peek: method that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front/top of the class, without removing it.
- isEmpty: method that takes no argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the class is empty
